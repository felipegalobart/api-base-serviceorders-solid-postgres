# 📄 Technical Project Report – Service Orders API

**Date:** 2025-09-05  
**Author:** Felipe Galobart  
**Project:** `api-base-serviceorders-solid-postgres`

---

## ✅ General Overview

This Node.js + TypeScript project is a **modular and scalable API** to manage service orders, users, products, and related entities. It follows key software architecture principles (SOLID, Factory Pattern, Clean Architecture) and includes modern tooling such as TypeORM, JWT, ESLint, and Prettier.

## 🧱 Technologies and Patterns

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Framework:** Fastify
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** TypeORM (in progress, migrating from raw SQL)
- **Auth:** JWT with middleware-based protection
- **Patterns:** SOLID Principles, Factory Pattern, Clean Architecture
- **Config:** `.env` + validation
- **Formatting:** ESLint + Prettier
- **Migrations:** TypeORM with CLI commands
- **Error Handling:** Global error middleware + custom errors
- **Project Scripts:**
  - `npm run start:dev` – Development server
  - `npm run build` – Compiles to `/build`
  - `npx typeorm migration:run` – Applies DB migrations

---

## ✅ What’s Done

- User and Product flows implemented with:
  - Create, Find, List methods
  - Category and Address association
- JWT authentication with signin and protected routes
- Factory functions for all use cases
- Middleware to validate JWT
- Error handler for known and unknown exceptions
- Migration system working
- Database is initialized via `.env` with `uuid-ossp`

---

## ⚠️ To Improve or Add

- ✅ Refactor all repositories to use interfaces only
- ❌ No tests implemented yet (Jest + Supertest recommended)
- ❌ Swagger or API documentation not configured
- ⚠️ `typeorm` and `pg` coexist — choose one officially
- ⚠️ Product `ICategory[]` interface uses optional `id`, may cause typing issues
- ⚠️ Consider extracting messages to constants
- ⚠️ JWT middleware could use `request.url` for route detection
- ❌ No Docker support / `.dockerignore` yet

---

## 🧪 Suggested Next Steps

- [ ] Add tests for use cases and controllers
- [ ] Finalize the migration to TypeORM
- [ ] Create API docs with Swagger or Postman
- [ ] Centralize all error/status messages
- [ ] Improve role-based route protection (e.g., isAdmin)

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This API is well-designed, clean, and follows excellent development practices.  
Once testing and documentation are added, it will be a **robust and production-ready base** for any service-order management system.
